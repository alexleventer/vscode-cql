# CQL support for VS Code
![Cassandra Logo](./cassandra.jpg)
## This is a language extension for the Cassandra CQL language.
Currently this addon only adds syntax highlighting for .cql files. This just makes it a bit easier to use the .cql extension without resorting to mapping .sql to .cql. It allows you to keep the two separate.
