# CQL support for VS Code

## This is a language extension for the Cassandra CQL language.
This is an extension for working with Cassandra CQL. This extension supports syntax highlighting. Table definitions found will allow intellisense to work. This extension will find symbols for tables and columns. All keywords have intellisense. There are snippets for basic CQL statements.

Currently Supports:
 - Syntax Highlighting
 - Brackets
 - Comments
 - Intellisense 
  - Keywords *(SELECT, ALTER, UUID, etc)*
  - Table Names* 
  - Column Names*
 - Snippets (SELECT, CREATE TABLE|KEYSPACE|TRIGGER|TYPE|INDEX, UPDATE)
  
Coming Soon:
 - Execute Statements
 - Context for Intellisense *(some)* 
 - ~~Better Internal Structure~~ (done)
 - Scan for Symbols
 - Search Cassandra for symbols
 - ~~Better Syntax Highlighting~~ (done)
