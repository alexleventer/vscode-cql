# CQL support for VS Code

## This is a language extension for the Cassandra CQL language.
Currently this addon only adds syntax highlighting for .cql files. This just makes it a bit easier to use the .cql extension without resorting to mapping .sql to .cql. Intellisense is provided for tables when we find a CREATE script.

Currently Supports:
 - Syntax Highlighting
 - Brackets
 - Comments
 - Intellisense 
  - All CQL Keywords <small>(SELECT, ALTER, UUID, etc)</small>
  - Table Names* 
  - Column Names*
  
Coming Soon:
 - Execute Statements
 - Context for Intellisense
 - More Structure
 - Scan for Symbols

<small>Table and Column names come from CREATE scripts.</small>

**Enjoy!** -LG
